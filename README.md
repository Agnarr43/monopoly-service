# CS 262 Monopoly Webservice

This is the data service application for the [CS 262 sample Monopoly project](https://github.com/calvin-cs262-organization/monopoly-project).

It is based on the standard Heroku with Node.js tutorial.

The database is relational and hosted on elephantsql.com. The database user
and password are stored as Heroku configuration variables.

We implement this as a separate repo to simplify Heroku integration.
