# CS 262 Monopoly Webservice

This repo implements a sample data-based webservice for CS 262 built based on 
the standard Heroku with Node.js tutorial.

<https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-nodejs>  

The database is relational and hosted on elephantsql.com. The database user
and password are stored as Heroku configuration variables.

We implement this as a separate repo to simplify Heroku integration.
